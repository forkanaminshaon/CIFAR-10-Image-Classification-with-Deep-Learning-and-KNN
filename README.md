# Deep-Learning-Project-CIFAR-10-Image-Classifier
CIFAR-10 Image Classifier is a deep learning project using CNNs (Keras/TensorFlow) to classify 60,000 32x32 color images into 10 classes like airplane, car, bird. GitHub repos typically include data loading, model training (80-90% accuracy), evaluation, and Jupyter notebooks with augmentation/preprocessing.
